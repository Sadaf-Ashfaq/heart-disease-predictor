Task Objective:
Build an AI-powered system to predict heart disease risk, featuring user authentication, a prediction dashboard, history tracking, and personalized health recommendations.

Dataset Used:
Heart Disease UCI Dataset (heart_disease.csv) with 13 health parameters (age, sex, chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, max heart rate, ST depression, etc.). Data is cleaned, preprocessed, and categorical variables encoded.

Models Applied:
Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier, with automatic selection of the best-performing model based on accuracy.

Key Results and Findings:

Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and classification reports generated.

Feature Importance: Key health indicators identified.

Risk Classification: Low (<30%), Moderate (30–60%), High (>60%) risk levels.

User Interface & Security: Real-time predictions, history tracking in SQLite, secure login, and protected routes.

Outcome: Reliable cardiovascular risk assessment with educational preventive recommendations.
